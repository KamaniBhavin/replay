# ðŸŽ¬ Replay - Chrome Extension

Replay is a chrome extension that lets you search through all the pages in your browsing history to find the one you can't remember. It uses cosine similarity search to find the page based on the content of the page and the search query provided by the user. Replay is built using Supabase DB and Supabase Auth, and OpenAI APIs to create embeddings for webpages, store them to Supabase, and find the page by computing cosine similarity between content of page and query.
